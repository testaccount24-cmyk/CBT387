Stonybrook Pascal Tape

The files on the Stonybrook Pascal tape were as follows:

 NOTE 1:     These files were downloaded to the PC with "no conversion",
          so they contain the original binary or EBCDIC representation.
          Also, there are no extra CR/LF characters to delimit records.

 NOTE 2:  I do not really remember a RECFM=FR, but that is what the
    "standard labels" on the tape actually indicated, and I was
    able to read the data just fine, by using RECFM=FB.

 NOTE 3:  I believe 7200 byte blocks was for "full-track" blocking
    on a 2314 drive. This is not a great choice on most other
    newer DASD devices, however.

    You might want to use a more "portable" blocksize, such
    as RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120 for source code files.
    This should not present any problems, as IEBGENER will
    re-block automatically (just keep the LRECL set to 80)
    when you copy from these "tape" files.

 NOTE 4:  The XPL system uses its own peculiar program loader that
    reads the "object code" from special OBJ files with a
    RECFM=F, LRECL=7200 and BLKSIZE=7200. If you want to
    change this, you will apparently have to change a constant
    DECLARE in the XCOM compiler (XCOM4.XPL), and recompile
    XCOM, and also change the constant in XPLSM.ASM, the
    runtime loader routine, and reassemble it. (Good luck!)

    By the way, an appropriate "portable" blocksize for this
    file should be 6140, which waste some space on 2314s, but,
    who really uses 2314s any more? (BLKSIZE=6140 fits 2 blocks
    per track on 3330s, and 3 records per track on 3350s.)

There is also a file named XPLPAS.TXT in the ZIP file, that is a
brief overview of how to install the Stonybrook Pascal compiler
under OS/360.  (This is the same as FILE01, converted to ASCII).

And, this file (README.TXT) is also included in the XPL.ZIP file.
